                <div class="work-description">
                    <p>The best thing about this challenge, is that it had a small responsive requirement which I enjoy working on. I'm getting used
                        to how flex-box works which has helped me find out another way in using flex-box. Upon seeing the design, I was already seeing
                        where I was going to use it, but wasn't so sure how I will do it.
                    </p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, like any other responsive design, I had to work mobile-first, which really helps when it comes to making the rest
                        of the project responsive to the design you want. I struggled a bit with the images in the cards, but after I realized that
                        a good choice of flex-box functions would make the trick, it all came together.
                    </p>
                    <p>After I finished the mobile design, I went on to do the finishing touches for the desktop design, but I then noticed that the
                        HTML structure for the cards wasn't going to make the design work, so I simply put the middle cards in a `.container`which then
                        made it work splendidly, and found out a new way to use flex-box to make layouts.
