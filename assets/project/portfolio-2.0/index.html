                <div class="work-description">
                    <p>Having recently earned the <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/11e73eb8-ad47-4477-a70a-15a7b575dfca" target="_blank" class="portfolio-text">Adobe Certified Professional in Web Authoring Using Adobe Dreamweaver</a>
                    certification through <a href="https://icemalta.com/" target="_blank" class="portfolio-text">ICE Malta</a>, I wanted to re-vamp my portfolio site and showcase my skills
                    as a web designer and a web developer by creating the initial design using a design tool which in this case was Figma, and then develop
                    the actual design into a working responsive website.</p>
                    <p>As one will be able to notice, some design areas aren't like how the portfolio is looking as I haven't yet found the answer to how I can 
                        create what I want to, however, I found alternatives that are working just fine, in order to still have my portfolio responsive and looking
                        slick. While it's not visible in the photo, I have also used the "comment" tool in Figma to provide more context to the design
                        and of how I want it to work, should the content has some sort of functionality to it.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../../img/projects/portfolio-highlight.png" alt="Preview of the highlight of my choice" class="portfolio-image-hide">
                    <video src="../../../assets/video/portfolioAnimation.mov.mp4" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" class="portfolio-video" aria-label="Video showcasing the project functionality"></video>
                    <p>If I had to choose my most favourite part of the site so far, I would go with the homepage animation. With a good amount of research
                        and some tweaks in the prompts I was giving to ChatGPT, I managed to find a way on how I can make the <em><strong>"languages and tools"</strong></em> section
                        move from right to left automatically on a mobile device. While it's nothing extraordinary, I thought of making such animation in order not to
                        over stack the display with all the content, and therefore, I made use the <em><strong>"invisible space"</strong></em>, or so I call it like that haha.
                    </p>
                    <p>I'm always seeking more knowledge, especially <em><strong>JavaScript and/or similar languages</strong></em> which by the time of this writing, I had 
                        enrolled myself in a Scrimba course of JavaScript, in order to improve my portfolio itself and also the future projects that I will be working on.
                        If you have any suggestions, tips or opinions, feel free to share them with me, I'd be happy to look into them and discuss them with you! </p>
