                <h3>The Process</h3>
                <p>The want for consistent improvement is big for me, especially when it comes to showcasing my own work. I'm constantly looking for ways on how I can improve myself, and I
                    wasn't fully vibing with my portfolio and how I was showcasing my work, therefore, I first searched for design tools as I wanted to have a better visual and functional way to
                    showcase what I'm designing. I ended up using <a href="https://www.framer.com/" target="_blank">Framer</a> as a design tool, and once I was happy with the design 
                    I then got on with updating my current portfolio.</p>

                <p>I found multiple challenges in actually making my design come to life, but with persistence and a well searched solution, I managed to overcome my obstacles. I have googled,
                    used YouTube and also ChatGPT to help me with code fixing, function implementation and also used it to understand some features of JavaScript more and why they were being used
                    in that way, to further solidify my knowledge.</p>
           </div>

           <!-- Design Section -->

           <div class="design">
               <h3>The Design</h3>

               <p>Whilst doing my search for new design tools I came across Webflow and also Framer. I have dabbled a bit in both, however, Framer took the W and ended up continuing using it for
                  this project. Framer has a bunch of solid tools along with easy implementation of responsive design. I do think that there are many more features they can implement in order
                  to have a bit more control on how one could actually design the project, however, with the current features Framer has, I managed to work well.</p>

               <p>They also have an AI feature which helped me in get some design ideas and then tweaked and turned them in a way that make sense for me and for the vibe I wanted to go for. I did
                  make external research as well to get design ideas, which has helped me tp finalise my portfolio look. The design itself is slightly different from the actual portfolio, mainly
                  because I was struggling to implement the actual design I wanted to make, so as usual, on the go designing was done.</p>

               <p>There are more features that I would like to implement, and also potentially improve the code itself, which all this will be done once I gain more knowledge and experience.</p>

           <!-- The Challenge Section -->

           <div class="challenge">
                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>Having that I updated the whole look and feel, and also improved the actual project showcase text and design, I pretty much had to re-do all pages which was quite of a challenge
                    for me, yet also very interesting as it gave the opportunity to re-do previous code, read it, understand it once again and make the needed changes. For the CSS file of the project showcase,
                    I decided to start it from fresh, as the design structure was very different than the previous design.</p>
                
                <p>I wanted to have a few features which I thought were only possible with JavaScript, however, with some research I found some videos and blogs were it actually showed that the
                    features could be done with CSS. So I have tested some possible designs on CodePen, and then implemented the actual feature to the project.</p>

                <p>For the navigation menu hide and show upon scroll, and for the "The Creative Section" feature text to show upon viewport is visible on devices bigger than mobile, I used ChatGPT
                    in order to help me implementing this function and provide me with a working JavaScript code.</p>
