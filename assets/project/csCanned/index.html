                            <p>This project is a re-creation of how I was introduced to coding back in 2021. A colleague and myself wanted to improve how we reply to the customers so we 
                                ended up making something of our own.</p>

                <h3>The Process</h3>
                <p>Back in 2021, I started my very first job in iGaming. It was interesting to learn about the use of canned replies/hotkeys because I had never used them before in previous jobs. 
                    While the concept was very interesting the way we used them wasn't that efficient, or at least that was my opinion, and of another colleague, so we decided to work on 
                    something for ourselves to then show to the management.</p>

                <p>Back then, I had no idea what I was doing. I remember that we used CodePen to do it, and that I was learning as we were working on it. Therefore, now I wanted to re-create 
                    the whole thing by myself, having that I have more understanding than before.The idea behind this project was to make our replies faster and efficient. 
                    With this company we were mostly using a word document with replies, highlighting, copy and then pasting in the chat (not that efficient) or the actual 
                    system itself which still wasn't as quick as I would have liked it to be.</p>
           </div>

           <!-- Design Section -->

           <div class="design">
               <h3>The Design</h3>

               <p>We used the same canned replies so that we still follow the company's procedures but created a more ideal way in having a single button, that with one click, it is 
                copied and we can simply paste it in the chat, which had made our process of getting the answer and replying to the customer much faster and better. For this specific project, 
                I used ChatGPT to tailor iGaming replies used by CS agents exclusively for my yet to be launched Amaz1ng Cas1no site. I then searched for the copy to clipboard snippet and 
                after understanding the JS snippet and how it was working, I then adjusted the code in order to function how I wanted it to work.</p>

               <p>For the look and feel of this project, I mostly coded it in my free time at work on CodePen, so I don't have a design file or design specs, mostly on the go design.</p>

                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>At the time I worked on this project, responsiveness was still very fresh and I didn't know much about JavaScript, however, I still worked my way in finding the answer
                    to how I can get the text copied to clipboard with one click and also worked on the functionality and responsiveness of the project, in order to be used for a customer 
                    support agent keeping the window in a small portion of the screen as demonstrated below.
