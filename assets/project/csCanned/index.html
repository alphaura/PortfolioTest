                <div class="work-description">
                    <p>Back in 2021, I started my very first job in iGaming. It was interesting to learn about the use of canned replies/hotkeys because
                        I had never used them before in previous jobs. While the concept was very interesting the way we used them wasn't that efficient,
                        or at least that was my opinion, and of another colleague, so we decided to work on something for ourselves to then show to the
                        management.</p>
                    <p>Back then, I had no idea what I was doing. I remember that we used codepen to do it, and that I was learning as we were working on it.
                       Therefore, now I wanted to re-create the whole thing by myself, having that I have more understanding than before.The idea behind this 
                       project was to make our replies faster and efficient. With this company we were mostly using a word document with replies, highlighting, 
                       copy and then pasting in the chat (not that efficient) or the actual system itself which still wasn't as quick as I would have liked it 
                       to be, and here is where this project came along.</p>
                    <p>We used the same canned replies so that we still follow the company's procedures but created a more ideal way in having a single 
                        button, that with one click, it is copied and we can simply paste it in the chat, which had made our process of getting the answer
                        and replying to the customer much faster and better.</p>
                    <p>For this specific project, I used ChatGPT to tailor iGaming replies used by CS agents exclusively for my yet to be launched Amaz1ng Cas1no
                        site. I then searched for the copy to clipboard snippet and after understanding the JS snippet and how it was working, I then
                        adjusted the code in order to function how I wanted it to work.
