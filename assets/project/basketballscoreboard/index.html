                <div class="work-description">
                    <p>This is my very first solo project using JavaScript without any guidance. While the <a href="../hitCounter/index.html" target="_blank">hit counter</a>
                    project was indeed my first project using while actually understanding the JavaScript functions being used, that project was more of a follow along 
                    project, where I was adding the JavaScript code while the educator was explaining the project.</p>
                    <p>In this specific project, things are different. Since I haven't subscribed to the <a href="https://scrimba.com/" target="_blank">Scrimba</a> paid plan, I obviously don't get the full
                    package of the course, therefore, the actual solo projects were off-limits for me, however, I didn't let that stop me. All I needed was the title, and 
                    I then made the magic work.</p>
                    <p>They mentioned that the solo project was about making a functional basketball scoreboard, and that's all I needed. I hopped onto Figma to get on with
                        <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/NSYNZXAujLWkW1KLvE36kL/Basketball-Scoreboard?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=GNJ8TdVayCRPb4qP-1" target="_blank">designing the project first</a>. Once I was happy with the design on mobile, tablet and desktop, I got onto the coding part. I first made sure that the HTML
                        structure makes sense to how I wanted the whole project to function (duh ðŸ™„). Once I was happy with the structure, I got onto the designing part and 
                        finished coding my CSS.</p>
                    <p>Once I saw that the design and responsiveness of the site were working fine, I got onto the actual functionality of the project, meaning JavaScript. I think that 
                        having a good structured HTML helps to get a better idea of how the JavaScript code will work in conjunction of the project idea, since we're 
                        linking two languages into one functionality or more. In this case the idea was that whenever a basket is made 3,2, or 1 point can be added separately
                        for both home and away while having the count separated and the final score of the home and away teams incremented accordingly.
